I am Anh Le, a PhD candidate in Political Economy at Duke University. My work focuses on studying the political economy of development and authoritarianism, using various quantitative methods. I will blog about programming and statistical techniques that are useful to data analysts beyond any field.

 Some interesting projects of mine:
 
 * [Scrape Craig's list RSS feed](https://github.com/LaDilettante/craigslist) and update the results in a database. My girlfriend was looking to buy a car on Craig's list, and I wrote those scripts to automate the process. One can specify the desirable search parameters, run the script, and the database will be updated to new results only.

 * [Teaching Assistant webapp](https://github.com/LaDilettante/TA_app). This year I'm teaching the R lab for our department's first-year PhDs. I created this Rails app to automate deadline annoucment, homework submission, and grading (by randomly assigning students to cross-grade). This allows students to see others' code and learn the material better. The site is live [here](https://polsci630.herokuapp.com), but sign-in is required to view students' data.
